## GitHub's Green Software Directory is a simple and easy-to-use resource that all developers can use to adopt green software tools. This list aims to help any developer find green software projects available on GitHub. 

### What is “Green Software”?
Green software meets all of our modern needs while being carbon aware and efficient. Only three activities reduce the carbon emissions of software: energy efficiency, carbon awareness, and hardware efficiency.

As technology industry energy use grows, we believe we have a responsibility to help support sustainable practices and reduce the environmental impact of software we build.

## Our Directory
We reviewed all repositories on GitHub that self-identified being green software tools as their primary purpose. We compiled these into a directory of resources built by our community, for our community. 

We were particularly inspired by the Green Software Foundation's [awesome-green-software](https://github.com/green-software-foundation/awesome-green-software) list, a valuable resource that has been developed by the Green Software Foundation community over the past few years, and the [Open Sustainable Technology](https://github.com/protontypes/open-sustainable-technology) directory. 

This list is managed by GitHub Sustainability with the Social Impact Team.

**Categories:**
- **[Measurement](#measurement)**
